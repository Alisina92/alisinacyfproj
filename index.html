        <p class="prag">
          The VW Beetle has become an iconic vehicle worldwide, and has built a huge loyal following. It is known by numerous names, for example, in Germany it’s a Kafer, in the USA a Bug or salon, England a Beetle etc. As the floor pan and running gear can be
          used without the body being attached, they became a firm favourite of the kit car builders. They were turned into Porsche 356 replicas, beach buggies, and Nova kit cars to mention just a few. When production stopped in 2003 in Mexico over 21
          million air-cooled Volkswagen Beetles had been produced. During eight decades of manufacturing came a whole variety of models, ranging from 25Hp through to the 1303S or Super Beetle with its Independent Rear Suspension (also known as IRS). Salons,
          sunroof models, cabrios and even specialist versions as police cars, German post office delivery vehicles and in Mexico City, the green and white Beetle taxi, with its missing passengers seat, was a common sight until recently.

        <p>
          Here are the main changes that took place to the Volkswagen Beetle during its eight decades of production.

        <li>
          <b class="intro">
<img class="splitscreen" src="https://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/7731289.jpg" alt="split rear screen VW">1936 > 1952 ‘Splitscreen Beetle,’</b> The Beetle story started in the early 1930’s, but production started officially in 1936.
          The Second World War all but stopped production until the British army rebuilt the factory and production commenced of the ‘Splitscreen’ Beetles (named after the shape of the small ‘split’ rear window). These were very basic cars with engines
          from 985cc (24bhp) to 1131cc (25bhp) but are rare and very desirable.

          <b class="intro">
<img class="oval" src="https://www.mdiecast.com/mpictures/autoart/79777_4.jpg" alt="VW with oval rear window">1953 > 1956 ‘Oval Beetle’</b> Very similar to the Splitscreen, but with the split removed from the rear window making it an oval. Small
          developments aimed at improving driver comfort and making the Beetle appeal to foreign markets, including a new 1192cc (30bhp) engine.

<img class="bigscreen" src="https://images.classiccult.com/vw-1200-a-standard-beetle-1965-backside.jpg" alt="VW Beetle with big screen">1957 > 67</b> Little difference in appearance from the Oval Beetle, the biggest being the rear window, which
          was enlarged in August 1957 to the large rectangular shape that would remain for the remainder of production. The windscreen and side glass were also enlarged in August 1964. These Beetles still retained the sloping headlights, long bonnet,
          link and king pin torsion bar front suspension and swing axle torsion bar suspension at the rear and 5 bolt wheels as previous models, but in Aug 1966 the link pins were replaced with ball joints and the wheels used four bolts instead of five.
          Engine options were now 1192cc (34bhp), 1285cc (40bhp) and in Aug 1966 the 1493cc engine with (44bhp).

<img class="last" src="http://www.lasteditionbeetle.org/images/general/ultima.jpg" alt="blue VW Beetle">1968 > 2003</b> August 1967 saw the first major styling change with upright headlights, a shorter bonnet and engine lid, plus an exterior
          mounted fuel filler cap. These models retained the torsion bar front suspension and swing axle rear suspension, which remained until the end of Brazilian production in 2003. The only exceptions were the semi-automatic Beetle which came with
          I.R.S rear suspension and the 1302 and 1303 models which used front coil springs... (see below). Engine options for these were 1192cc (34bhp), 1285cc (44bhp), 1493cc engine with (44bhp) and 1584cc (50bhp).
